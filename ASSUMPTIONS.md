The solution of finding the minimum path in triangle based on dynamic programming algorithm.

I used ZIO, read the file from stream and save data into the Ref to be more safe and follow FP. 
For sure, we can make it more simple :)
Then the main logic for finding the minimum path comes.
Also I did handle some special cases like empty files, files we could not parse.
